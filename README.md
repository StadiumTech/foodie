Why did you make this?
-------------------

Say that you are seated at the big game. Say you finally got the kids out of the car, say you finally got your spouse to find the seats, and all you want to do is sit, relax, and enjoy the game. 

But... you hear your stomach growling. You're hungry. Shoot, the game is just getting started!

Here is where FOODIE comes in.

You take out your cellphone, browse the food options available your stadium, and order right from the comfort of your seat. Within minutes, your meal is brought to you and you never missed any of the action!

We as a team saw there was a ___problem___ with the sports fan experience and venue. Our product is a viable ___solution___!

Hasn't this already been done before?
---------

This idea has been _tested_ but never got off the ground. __Seat Serve__, a 2015 company attempted this idea but only in one stadium, and only in one section of seating. They charged the Internet but never passed a thousand downloads, targeting only soccer in Amsterdam.

This effort proves to us that it is a marketable idea, but it needs to be done with usability and in a scalable fashion.
